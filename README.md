# Bug-Tracking-System
This web application used a framework called CodeIgniter. To use these code, you need to 
1.	Download CodeIgniter package from its official website and unzip it
2.	Delete the “application” directory and everything under it (from the downloaded CodeIgniter package)
3.	Replace it by the “application” folder fetched from GitHub
4.	Place the whole unzipped CodeIgniter package to a PHP server

In addition, there is a proposal introducing this bug tracking system.
